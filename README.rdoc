I recently developed a small application to track the money in your friend circle. I made this application for my own use. As me and my friends (like everyone) travels a lot. So after coming from a tour  the answer to big question " who will pay who and how much " was quite difficult and hectic. So I tried to make it more easy with the help of this application.



Moreover you can also use the application directly.Just go to this link http://hisab.herokuapp.com/.
